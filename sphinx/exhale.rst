Exhale
======

`Exhale <https://exhale.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
can be used to generate documention for C++ code
which is documented with `Doxygen <http://www.doxygen.nl/>`_.

The advantage of using ``Exahle`` is that it can generate
the sphinx style webpage pages which looks more modern than Doxygen.
